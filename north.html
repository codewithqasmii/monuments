            <div data-city="petra">
                <p>Built around 312BC, Petra was rediscovered by a Swiss explorer - Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in
                    1812.
                    Reckoned as Lost City, Petra was almost extinct as it remained buried beneath the layers of
                    sand for
                    centuries. After a long excavation work conducted on the site, Petra came to the surface and
                    became
                    one of the seven wonders of the world for a valid reason. It is one of the oldest cities in
                    the
                    world that is a classic example of the most extraordinary prehistoric civilizations. Also
                    known as
                    the Rose City, this sprawling UNESCO World Heritage is home to about 800 tombs with pink
                    facades.<br>
                    Petra is an ancient city that was carved out of rock in southwest Jordan. The biblical name
                    of Petra
                    is Sela, which was probably replaced by the Greek name Petra, meaning rock. Petra used to be
                    an
                    Oasis in the desert supporting the ancient city’s large population as the inhabitants were
                    experts
                    at surviving in the desert making it one of the most famous landmarks in the world. The
                    Romans were
                    eager to expand the boundaries of their empire and took over Petra in A.D. 106 the city
                    lived
                    without much change but the empire left an unforgettable mark on the ancient city.
                    <span class="dots">...</span>
                    <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                        <br>
                        The distinct Roman style can be seen all over Petra, in the monuments, sculptures, and
                        public
                        spaces and even in the city’s design. In A.D. 330, a constitutive event took place in
                        the Roman
                        Empire as the first Christian emperor, Constantine I, moved the main capital from Rome
                        to the
                        city of Byzantium presently known as Istanbul. Rulers of this new Byzantine Empire
                        wanted to
                        spread Christianity and over the years people of Petra abandoned their beliefs for this
                        new
                        religion. The city’s main Cathedral, the Petra Church became a symbol of the new era.
                        <br>
                        Carved directly into rose-red cliffs, Petra—the ancient capital of the Nabatean
                        kingdom—is an
                        archaeological and artistic marvel. Known as the ‘Rose City’ due to the color of its
                        rock, it’s
                        a testament to the artistry, religious practices, and trade ambitions of the Nabateans.
                        Established as early as 312 BC, Petra flourished due to its position along major trade
                        routes.
                        <br>
                        The entrance, through a narrow gorge known as the Siq, dramatically reveals Petra’s most
                        iconic
                        structure, Al-Khazneh (the Treasury). This architectural masterpiece, adorned with
                        intricate
                        Hellenistic facades, underscores the synthesis of Eastern and Western artistic
                        traditions,
                        offering a visual narrative of a once-thriving desert empire. <br>
                        The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among
                        sandstone
                        mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be one of the places where Moses struck a rock
                        and
                        water gushed forth. Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and
                        during this
                        time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially for spices. Noted
                        carvers,
                        the Nabataeans chiseled dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed
                        color
                        with the shifting sun. In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for
                        lush
                        gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. The
                        city
                        beganto decline, however, as trade routes shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused
                        more
                        difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned. Although
                        rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by archaeologists until the late 20th
                        century, and
                        many questions remain about the city. <br>

                <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian
                    pyramid and served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the
                    Old
                    Kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, over a period of about 27 years, the pyramid is
                    the
                    oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained
                    largely
                    intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is part of the
                    UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis". It is situated at the northern end of the
                    line
                    of the three pyramids at Giza. <br>

                    Pyramids of Giza hold immense universal value as they are the largest and most prominent
                    pyramid
                    structures in the world. These mammoth sized pyramids are symbols of the great Egyptian
                    civilization that flourished during the old kingdom in 2686 to 2181 BCE. The Egyptians
                    believed
                    in the afterlife and erected these elaborate pyramids to honour the Pharaohs. The Pyramid of
                    Khufu is open for tourists and gives you an opportunity to discover other mummies of popular
                    Pharaohs such as Djoser, Khafre, and Menkaure. This is one of the famous historical
                    monuments in
                    the world that will leave you awestruck with diverse cultural beliefs and legacy of eras
                    gone

                        <br>
                        Rising starkly against the Egyptian desert are the Pyramids of Giza, particularly the
                        Great
                        Pyramid of Khufu—structures that have long captured the world’s imagination. Built
                        around
                        2580-2560 BC, these pyramids are stellar examples of ancient engineering and cosmic
                        precision. Designed as monumental tombs, they are layered with symbolism and astronomic
                        alignments. <br>
                        The precision with which these colossal structures were built, with massive limestone
                        blocks, and their alignment to the stars of Orion’s Belt, speaks of an ancient
                        civilization’s deep connection with the cosmos and the afterlife. Today, they remain
                        both an
                        enigma and a testament to Pharaonic ambition. <br>
                        Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest
                        human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white
                        limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the current 138.5
                        metres
                        (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the underlying core structure <br>
                        The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks, weighing
                        6
                        million tonnes in total. The majority of the stones are not uniform in size or shape,
                        and
                        are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily
                        local
                        limestone from the Giza Plateau was used for its construction. Other blocks were
                        imported by
                        boat on the Nile: white limestone from Tura for the casing, and blocks of granite from
                        Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the "King's Chamber" structure. <br>

                <p>Built during the reign of the first Chinese emperor - Qin Shi Huang, the Great Wall of China
                    is
                    recognized as one of the famous UNESCO World Heritage sites. This massive fortification was
                    raised to protect the territory from foreign invasions. It is claimed that the Great Wall of
                    China is the only man made structure that is visible from space, however, there are
                    contradictions to the belief. Even if this 13,000 mile fortification is not visible from
                    space,
                    it is totally worth visiting at least once in a lifetime. <br>
                    Winding its way across China’s northern expanses, the Great Wall is not merely a colossal
                    fortification—it’s a symbol of a nation’s legacy and resilience. With origins tracing back
                    to
                    the 7th century BC, this monumental barrier, spanning over 13,000 miles, is the culmination
                    of
                    the endeavors of multiple Chinese dynasties. While its primary role was military defense,
                    the
                    Wall transcends this utilitarian purpose.

                        It stands as a testament to collective perseverance, unity, and the indomitable will of
                        generations. Traversing its meandering stretches, one doesn’t just witness formidable
                        watchtowers and battlements but also experiences the architectural nuances of the
                        diverse
                        epochs it represents, offering a vivid immersion into China’s rich historical continuum.
                        <br>
                        The Great Wall of China is the longest wall in the world stretching up to 21,000 Km. It
                        was
                        built by several dynasties over hundreds of years starting in about 220 B.C. The Great
                        Wall
                        stretches from west to east in northern China making it one of the historical monuments
                        of
                        the world. A famous section of The Great Wall of China that you might take under
                        consideration to visit are Shanhaiguan Pass also known as ‘First Pass under Heaven’
                        because
                        it is the first pass along The Great Wall of China in the east. <br>
                        Laolongtou Great Wall (Old Dragon’s Head) is where The Great Wall of China meets the sea
                        resembling the Dragon drinking water from the sea. Jiayuguan Great Wall is a pass
                        standing
                        at the western end of the Ming Dynasty Great Wall. It is different from the well-known
                        sections built with stones and bricks rather it was built with rammed earth, making
                        yellow
                        its dominant hue and blending with the surrounding desert. <br>
                        Dunhuang Great Wall was built more than 1,300 years earlier than the Ming sections. Due
                        to
                        natural disasters and destruction by mankind it is hard to find much of the original
                        wall
                        which is a reminder for us to preserve and maintain. <br>

                        of his days not as a ruler but as a prisoner when his son Aurangzeb seized the Mughal
