                <p>The relics of Machu Picchu are evidence of the imposing prominence of Incas when they were basking in
                    the glory of power and position. This striking archaeological site of Peru is nestled in the slopes
                    of the Andes and is a top attraction for tourists across the globe. It is often referred to as the
                    Lost City of Incas which was discovered by the explorer, Hiram Bingham III in 1911. It is one of the
                    most gorgeous historic sites in the world that is perched at the altitude of 2,430 m right in the
                    heart of Cusco Region in Peru. <br>

                    Perched high among the Andean peaks, shrouded in mist and mystery, lies Machu Picchu—the famed ‘Lost
                    City of the Incas’. Built-in the 15th century under Emperor Pachacuti as a royal estate, this
                    archaeological treasure is a testament to Incan architectural prowess. With finely crafted stone
                    constructions that seamlessly blend with the mountainous landscape, Machu Picchu was both a
                    ceremonial site and an astronomical observatory.

                        hidden from the world until its rediscovery in 1911. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site,
                        it has become an iconic symbol of Peru's cultural heritage, captivating visitors with its
                        enigmatic ruins, stunning mountain backdrop, and a profound connection to the ancient Andean
                        civilization. <br>

                    is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor
                    Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French
                    engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between
                    1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The
                    arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5]
                    Christ The Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large
                    Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally
                    accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide. <br>

                    The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the
                    700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de
                    Janeiro. This statue is the largest Art Deco style sculpture in the world.[6] A symbol of
                    Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and
                    Brazil and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.

                <p>Easter Island — that mystical place with giant stone heads, right? But where the heck is it? Is it
                    some holiday-themed amusement park? Nope, it’s an actual island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean,
                    also known as Rapa Nui to the indigenous Polynesians who have lived there for centuries, and it is
                    home to the famous Maoi. <br>

                    According to one theory, the first Polynesian settlers arrived on Rapa Nui in canoes around 1200 AD,
                    after navigating thousands of miles of open ocean using only the stars, currents, and their
                    navigational skills. <br>

                    But settling on the island was a different walk in the park. Rapa Nui’s isolation meant its
                    inhabitants had to adapt to a unique environment with limited resources. They relied on fishing,
                    agriculture, and the occasional seabird for sustenance, and they used the island’s volcanic rocks to
                    build shelter and tools. In short, they had to be resourceful and resilient to survive.

                    <span class="dots">...</span>
                    <span class="more" style="display: none;">
                        <br>
                        Set against the vast backdrop of the Pacific Ocean, the Moai statues of Easter Island are more
                        than just monolithic stone heads. Crafted between 1250 and 1500 AD by the Rapa Nui people, these
                        statues likely represented deified ancestors. Some theories suggest that they were carved and
                        erected as part of socio-religious practices, possibly linked to agricultural fertility and
                        leadership rites. <br>
                        The sheer scale of these sculptures, some weighing up to 82 tons and standing 33 feet tall,
                        raises intriguing questions about transportation and construction techniques. Their oversized
                        heads, often tilted slightly upwards, seem to gaze skyward, as if waiting for the return of the
                        gods or perhaps watching over the island’s inhabitants. The presence of these silent sentinels
                        on such a remote island underscores humanity’s innate desire to immortalize its beliefs, even in
                        isolation.

                <p>TLas Lajas Sanctuary is a Roman Catholic basilica church in Colombia that is built inside the
                    Guáitara River canyon. It is also known as Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de las
                    Lajas, which translates to "the National Shrine Basilica of Our Lady of Las Lajas," and Santuario de
                    Las Lajas, which means “shrine of stone slabs.” <br>
                    The Columbian church is near the city of Ipiales, in the state of Nariño on the border with Ecuador.
                    Las Lajas Sanctuary received a coronation from the Catholic Church in 1952 and was designated as a
                    minor basilica in 1994.

                        <br>
                        The church, first built in the eighteenth century, has been remodeled and rebuilt over the
                        centuries. Las Lajas Sanctuary is an example of Gothic Revival style, with a vaulted ceiling,
                        buttresses, and spires. The inside of the church is white with gold trim, and it is ninety feet
                        long and fifty feet wide. <br>

                        Las Lajas Sanctuary is 330 feet tall from the bottom of the Guáitara Canyon against one side of
                        the canyon on a hill. A 160-foot-tall bridge over the Guáitara River connects the church to the
                        other side of the canyon. The entrance to the church is 150 feet over the canyon, and from
                        above, the roof of Las Lajas Sanctuary resembles a Catholic cross.
